## Abstract Factory Pattern (Creational)

This repository demonstrates the **Abstract Factory Pattern** implemented in **.NET (C#)** using clean, readable, and easy-to-understand code.

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

▶️ How to Run

The pattern usage is executed from Program.cs:
using creational.abstract_factory.ui_component_demo;

new AbstractFactoryUIComponentDemo().Run();
